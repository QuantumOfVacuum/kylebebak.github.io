Code, __TILs__, inspired by [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), and rants. I stole the idea for TILs, and most of the formatting for the [map]({{ '/site-map' | prepend: site.baseurl }}), from [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).

I'm a programmer that lives between Mexico City and California. Apart from coding, I read, write, walk my dog, and watch Messi play football. My website for non-static stuff is <http://dronfelipe.com>.
