[Seti UI](https://github.com/ctf0/Seti_ST3) is an amazing Sublime Text 3 theme ported from the Atom theme of the same name. It provides beautiful sidebar icons, like [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme), but with fewer stylistic gimmicks. It also sports beautiful blue/yellow highlighted text in the Command Palette, the Completion Popup, and the Goto Window. You can install it with  Package Control.

## Issues
There were a few things that bothered me about Seti UI out of the box:

- You can't see many files and folders in the sidebar, because there's too much padding between rows.
- The text inputs in the __Bottom Panel__ and the __Command Palette__ have a black background. The panels surrounding the text inputs are also black.
  - It's not obvious that these are text inputs.
  - If the text in them is selected, it's very difficult to read.

Fortunately the theme is easy enough to customize. I'll explain how I made my changes, in case you'd like to make some of them yourself, and you don't know where to start.

## Tweaks

To get more stuff into your sidebar, you can simply insert `"Seti_sb_small_padding": true` into your `Preferences.sublime-settings`. This will greatly reduce the padding between rows. For me however, it made things a little __too__ cluttered. If you want complete control over this padding, all you have to do is open `Packages/Seti_UI/Seti.sublime-theme`, look for `Seti_sb_small_padding` and change the value of `row_padding` from `[8,3]` to `[8,4]` or `[8,5]`, or whatever you prefer.

~~~json

{
    "class": "sidebar_tree",
    "settings": ["Seti_sb_small_padding"],
    "row_padding": [8,5]
},

~~~

Modifying the text inputs is trickier, because their styles aren't defined in `Packages/Seti_UI/Seti.sublime-theme`, but rather in `Packages/Seti_UI/Main/Widget - Seti.stTheme`, which is XML instead of JSON. Here are the fields you need to modify.

~~~xml

    <key>background</key>
    <string>#313131</string>

    ...

    <key>selection</key>
    <string>#00ffff</string>

~~~

The best way to do this is to create the `Seti_UI` directory in `Packages/User`, and copy the two config files into this directory. This will make sure the base config is read from `Packages/Seti_UI`, while your custom config is read from `Packages/User/Seti_UI`. The only other thing you need to do is edit `Packages/Seti_UI/Widgets/Widget - Seti.sublime-settings`, so that the `color_scheme` property points to your custom widget.

~~~json
{
    "color_scheme": "Packages/User/Seti_UI/Main/Widget - Seti.stTheme",
    "draw_shadows": false
}
~~~

If you do this, your custom config won't get clobbered every time Package Control installs an update for Seti UI!

This is what it looks like on my machine: the sidebar chock full of folders and files, and clearly demarcated text inputs with clearly visible text, even when it's selected. Word.
