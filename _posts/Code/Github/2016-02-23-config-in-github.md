Having these in version control is nice, especially for configuring a new dev machine.

## Sublime Text User directory
`~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User`  
The [Packages/User directory](https://github.com/kylebebak/sublime_text_config.git) containing all the bells and whistles I've added to Sublime Text.

## Dotfiles
`$HOME/dotfiles`  
My [dotfiles](https://github.com/kylebebak/dotfiles.git), all with symlinks up to `$HOME`.
