Here's a good article, written by Farhad Manjoo. The slug says it all: [twitter-to-save-itself-must-scale-back-world-swallowing-ambitions](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/technology/twitter-to-save-itself-must-scale-back-world-swallowing-ambitions.html).

>“Maybe Twitter is not meant to be the most popular band in the world,” said Anil Dash, a longtime user of Twitter and the chief executive of ThinkUp, a start-up that intends to improve how people use social networks. “Maybe it's meant to be merely Pearl Jam and not U2, and maybe Twitter could find equilibrium as a company with an enterprise value of merely $5 billion.”

Wall Street has condemning Twitter as a failure is [sort of perverse](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/02/twitter-failure/463248/) given that it has ~300M users and $500M quarterly revenue.

Anyway, what recently struck me about Twitter was not its prospects for the future, but just how much some people use it. I was drinking a beer overlooking the Zócalo and felt a sudden compulsion to multiply and divide. Farhad Manjoo has [81.1k tweets in 9 years](https://twitter.com/fmanjoo). That's about 25 tweets a day. Assuming it takes him 5 minutes to cook up and write a tweet, for the last decade he's spent 15% of his waking life just _sending_ tweets.

Not that that's necessarily bad, as my title would suggest. Maybe tweets are haiku for the 21st century, and the most obsessive __tweeters__ are digital Zen poets.
