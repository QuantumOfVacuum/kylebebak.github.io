    Whether it's Jewish men demanding that their personal religious views take precedence over the right of women airline passengers to enjoy their flights in peace, or Christian men in legislatures and courts demanding that their personal religious views take precedence over the right of women in their childbearing years to control their own bodies, or Islamic men demanding that their personal religious views take precedence over the right of their wives and daughters to shake hands with male business acquaintances, or men in a hundred other religions demanding that their personal religious views be given precedence in order to oppress women in a thousand other ways, it's all the same: Oppression of women masquerading as religious piety, and always demanding that the world accommodate and enable the oppression.
