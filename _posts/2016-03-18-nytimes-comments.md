I think the people at the New York Times were among the first in their business to realize that for newspapers, comments are the best user generated content. Good comments make reading articles a lot more addictive, and are the in the foundation of any good online community.

Instead of citing a bunch of numbers to make my case, I decided to compare what was published in the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/us/antonin-scalia-death.html) and the [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-antonin-scalia-20160213-story.html) after a recent high-profile event: the death of Antonin Scalia.

Here's [another article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/27/world/middleeast/woman-81-to-sue-israeli-airline-over-seat-switch.html) with comments in the thousands, and one particular NYT Pick with more than 3000 upvotes:

    Whether it's Jewish men demanding that their personal religious views take precedence over the right of women airline passengers to enjoy their flights in peace, or Christian men in legislatures and courts demanding that their personal religious views take precedence over the right of women in their childbearing years to control their own bodies, or Islamic men demanding that their personal religious views take precedence over the right of their wives and daughters to shake hands with male business acquaintances, or men in a hundred other religions demanding that their personal religious views be given precedence in order to oppress women in a thousand other ways, it's all the same: Oppression of women masquerading as religious piety, and always demanding that the world accommodate and enable the oppression.
