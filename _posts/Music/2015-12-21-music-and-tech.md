Robert Christgau is the only music critic I've ever read compulsively. His enormous online catalog of reviews makes binging easy. Here he is in a recent interview:

>“The notion that no current popular music is of quality is philistine.”

He's right, but this borders on tautology. After all, _some_ of it must be good.

He implicitly shies away from saying if it's gotten better, or if it's gotten _worse_, and with good reason. As a man who's written with nuance and humanity about 15000 albums, and who's approaching the end of his career, I'm sure he'd rather not be remembered as one of those cranks that complain it's all gone to shit.

But I think it has, a little, and I aim to prove it via the method of cherry-picking examples and asking rhetorical questions.

In 1970 soul was [Al Green](http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/green-76.php). In 2016 soul is [Adele](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-singularity-of-adeles-soul).

In 1965 the biggest act in the world was the Beatles. In 1820 it was Beethoven. In 2016 its Beyoncé, whose hits are written by a [pair of Norwegians armed with Auto-Tune](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/03/26/the-song-machine).

In 1965 Palo Alto produced The Grateful Dead and a year later San Francisco produced Sly Stone, musicians that tried to experience life and death, that joined "the fatalism of the physical frontier with the wonder of the psychedelic one". In 2016 SF produces Uber and [120 million dollar mayonnaise](../code/random/software-eating-the-world).

Ask yourself: 50 years from now, will people regard Beyoncé like they regard the Beatles? Or like they regard Beethoven?

What the fuck happened? Could money have anything to do with it?
