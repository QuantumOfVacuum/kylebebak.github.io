Code, __TILs__, inspired by [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), and rants about other stuff, like music and footy. The site itself is generated by __Jekyll__ and hosted by GitHub, using the wonderful and free __GitHub Pages__. The markdown for the site map is generated by Python scripts in [_map](_map). Check the Git hooks in [_hooks](_hooks) to see how.

## About

I stole the idea for TILs, and most of the formatting for the site map, from [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).
