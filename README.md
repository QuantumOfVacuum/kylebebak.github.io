Code and rants about other stuff, like music and footy. The site itself is generated by __Jekyll__ and hosted by GitHub, using the wonderful and free __GitHub Pages__. The categories and tags pages are generated by Python scripts in [_build](_build).

## Installation
Via `bundle` and `pip`. From the root directory, run `bundle`, and `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Continuous Integration
Done via Git hooks. These live in [_hooks](_hooks), and are deployed to `.git/hooks`, like this:

~~~sh
cd .git/hooks && ln -s -f ../../_hooks/* ./
~~~

Before commits, `_includes/categories.md` and `_includes/tags.html` are regenerated and added to the commit.

To check links, I run [LinkChecker](https://github.com/wummel/linkchecker/) against the site, using:

~~~sh
# local
linkchecker --no-warnings http://127.0.0.1:4000/
# production
linkchecker --no-warnings http://kylebebak.github.io/
~~~

I don't use `LinkChecker` in Git hooks because it's sort of slow, and also the scripts in [_build](_build) are written for Python 3, while `LinkChecker` is written for Python 2. The relevant field in LinkChecker's output is `Parent URL`, which points to a file containing a broken link.
